WOE FROM WIT

<p class="step1">Let's drop it. Arguments aside !</p>
<p class="step2">I'm sorry for Molchalin for I wasn't right;</p>
<p class="step3">He may be different from what he used to be,</p>
<p class="step4">Such changes do occur, I will agree,</p>
<b style="font-size: 50px;" style="font:class="step5">Changes in minds and morals, governments and rules,</b>
<p class="step6"> There are important people that were known to be fools,</p>

    <br>I'm afraid to mention them but you'll agree:</br>
Some weren't successful in the army, some in poetry
And others - everybody says -
Have grown much too clever in recent years.
Molchalin may be bright and bold, it's true,
But has he got emotions, passions
To think the world without you
To be just vanity and ashes ?
And is he sensitive enough
To have his heart-beat speeded up by love ?
So that whatever he might think and do
Would be entirely for you ?
That's what I feel, but words just fail me.
I'm overwhelmed, I'm in despair,
It's such a feeling that I couldn't wish an enemy.
And he? Just hangs his head and doesn't seem to care,
He's timid. All such men are quiet,
He has a mystery of some kind.</p>
  </div>

  

<p style="font-size:40px" <div class="bottom">
  Good knows what is it you've inspired
In him. Something he never had in mind.
Of all the merits, quite a few
He has inherited from you.
It isn't he who's sinful, it is you.
No, no, he may be wise and clever, too.
Is he a match for you? - that is the question.
As someone you grew up together with
A friend of yours, your nearest relation,
I want you to dispel my doubts, please,
So that I take the loss with ease.
I shall take care not to lose my mind,
I'll go away to fall in reverie
And never think of love. Yet I shall find
A way to having fun and making merry.
